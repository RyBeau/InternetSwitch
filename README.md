# InternetSwitch 
This is a simple Python GUI program that will enable/disable network interfaces on windows 10. I built this as I need a quick way to switch my PC between 
the capped data and uncapped data network at my university hall of residence. It uses the ntesh command in CMD to identify the available network interfaces and to
enable and disable interfaces. Interface information is stores in a .interfaces file to allow persistance across application restarts.
